# 0050 — Apps in processes of their own

Status: proposed (0.99.400), to be decided with the owner

## Context

ADR 0049 makes a slow callback caught three times -- lint, the gate, the log
and the pause -- and says plainly what it cannot do: the first slow run
still stops every display, because every app runs in the desktop's own
process. X has the same rule for its server and a different answer for its
clients: each is a process of its own, so a client that hangs hangs only
its own windows.

The desktop cannot do that today, for one reason recorded in CLAUDE.md:
a window draws into the one grid the console owns, through
`console put -p`, and a pane has no cells of its own. Giving each pane its
own cells and composing them at flush was built once and worked -- until
the picture modules, which write at absolute coordinates (`img draw`, and
media, web and the pager through it), could not be placed in either order
against a pane's own chrome. `dp_api` has no paned put for a picture.

## Proposal

In three steps, each a release that stands on its own:

1. **Panes own their cells.** A paned put and fill are offered beside
   `dp_api` (a sibling `"pane"` interface, as `"scroll"` was, so `dp_api`'s
   own version does not move); `dp->image` has taken a pane since version
   5. The five modules that write at absolute coordinates inside a window
   -- term, img, media, web and xscr -- move onto them (most, hvi, mon and
   trace take the whole console and need nothing), and the console
   composes panes at flush, bottom to top. Measured against today before it
   is kept: a frame with nothing changed must not cost more. The design and
   its review are on Gitea #421.
2. **A pane can be drawn from another process.** The console offers a pane's
   cells over a socket -- a write of cells, as `hold` already carries cells
   between processes -- so an app can draw its window from a process of its
   own. The window manager keeps focus, stacking, the menus and input, and
   hands an app its keys and clicks as messages.
3. **Apps move out one at a time**, starting with the ones that do the most
   work (the Browser, YouTube, Task Manager, Files), each a child of the
   desktop that a hang, a crash or a slow callback takes down alone. An app
   in a process of its own needs no budget, no pause and no lint rule: what
   it does with its own time is its own.

## Costs, said plainly

- Memory: a hibr process per app, about 2 MB resident each.
- Latency: a key reaches an app as a message and its window comes back as
  cells, two hops where today there are none.
- Work: a paned put beside `dp_api` and five modules, then a protocol, then each app.
- What stays in-process stays fast; an app moved out cannot be cheaper to
  draw than it is now, only unable to stop anyone else.

## Status

Step 1 accepted (owner, 2026-11-01): panes own their cells, and pictures
draw through panes, kept only if a frame costs no more than today, with a
second opinion on the rendering before it is built. Steps 2 and 3 --
drawing a pane from another process, and moving apps out -- are decided on
step 1's measurement, not before. Asked as "what is our end-all solution
for a bad app?": this is it, since every other layer (lint, the budget's
diagnostics, jobs and asynchronous verbs) protects only against an app
whose author can be asked to change it. Pausing, hiding or withholding
keys from an app is not an answer and does not come back (0.99.401).
