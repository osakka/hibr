# Changelog

## 0.21

**Renamed from `nsh` to `hibr`** — Hackable In-process Bash Runtime, and
**حِبر**, Arabic for ink. Every macro, exported symbol, filename and
user-visible name changed with it: `$HIBR_RC`, `$HIBR_MODPATH`,
`$HIBR_HISTFILE`, `$HIBR_TLS_INSECURE`, `$HIBR_DEBUG`, `~/.hibrc`,
`~/.hibr_history`, and `include/hibr.h`. The module ABI moved to **3**, since
a module built against the old headers can no longer link. Reasoning and the
names considered: [decision 0015](docs/adr/0015-the-name-is-hibr.md).

Documentation reorganised. The README is an overview; the detail moved to
`docs/`, every directory carries its own `README.md`, and the deliberate
divergences from bash each became a decision record under `docs/adr/`.

`deploy.sh` builds with the right module directory, runs the suite, keeps the
previous installation for rollback, verifies the copy it installed, and can
keep itself current with a systemd timer or cron. A `MODDIR`-related bug is
fixed along the way: `make install PREFIX=X` produced a binary that could not
find its own modules, because the module directory is compiled in and changing
it did not force a rebuild.

A prompt built in process: `PROMPT_FN` names a function, builtin or module
builtin whose result slot becomes the prompt, with `$STATUS` and `$DURATION`
set for it. The `prompt` module renders segments from a `PROMPT[...]` map with
a `[text](style)` and `(conditional)` format language — directory, git branch
and repository state, exit status, command duration, jobs, and the usual
environment and language markers, all without forking. Modules are searched for
on `$HIBR_MODPATH` and in the install directory, so `mod load prompt` works.
Multi-line prompts are measured correctly by the line editor.

The module now reads git's object store itself: a DEFLATE decoder, loose
objects, pack indexes v1 and v2, and delta chains through both `OFS_DELTA` and
`REF_DELTA`, with alternates followed. No zlib, no `git`, no forks.
`prompt object [-p] <sha>` reads one object, for inspection.

The `git` segment now reports the working tree: `.git/index` in versions 2, 3
and 4, staged changes by diffing the index against HEAD's tree, modified and
deleted files by stat data and by hashing when that is inconclusive, untracked
files with `.gitignore`, `info/exclude` and `core.excludesFile` honoured, exact
renames, conflicts, and distance from the upstream branch by walking both
histories. It carries its own SHA-1 for this. All of it in process.

Fixed a signed overflow in the lexer: a run of more than ten digits before `<`
or `>` overflowed the descriptor number it was scanning for.

## 0.20
Arithmetic statements `((…))`, `let`, `for ((;;))`, a rebuilt evaluator with
assignment operators, `++`/`--`, `?:`, comma and `**`, two's-complement overflow
defined and UBSan-clean. `+=` for strings, arrays and map entries. `[[ ]]` with
short-circuiting and `=~` into `M`. `select`, `!!` history expansion,
`history -s/-p`, `CDPATH`.

## 0.19
`${x:off:len}`, `${a[@]:off:len}`, `${x^^}` family, `$RANDOM $SECONDS $PPID
$UID $EUID $HOSTNAME`, `printf -v`, `echo -e`, `unset a[k]`, `wait PID`,
`local a=(…)`. `:=` clears the slot and suppresses builtin output.

## 0.18
Declared arguments with `opt` and `args`; `title` renames the process. `ls`
module. `printf` width overflow fixed.

## 0.17
Module ABI v2: map access, result slot, errors, sockets, and `/dev/<name>/`
scheme registration; `http` reference module. `make install`, `make check`,
`--help`, `-n`. Parser fuzzer; recursion bounded. Opt-in strict expansion
`set -S`.

## 0.16 and earlier
Brace expansion, `$'…'`, globstar. Completion over PATH, variables and user
hooks; `&>`, `<<<`, `>|`, `{fd}>`, `read` options, `command`, `builtin`,
`getopts`, `umask`, `time`, `disown`. `fail`/`try`/`trap ERR`. JSON, `str`,
`arr`. Networking and TLS. Daily-driver features: `.hibrc`, prompts, aliases,
dirstack, `^R`. Nested maps, regex, typed `fn`, result slots. Job control,
`case`, `local`, heredocs, errexit, the line editor, modules, and the core
shell.
